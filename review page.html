            <p><big>"Napoleon Hill, then a young special investigator for a nationally known business magazine, 
                was sent to interview Andrew Carnegie. During that interview, Carnegie slyly dropped a hint of a 
                certain master power he used—a magic law of the human mind, a little-known psychological 
                principle—that was amazing in its power. Carnegie suggested to Hill that upon that principle he could
                 build the philosophy of all personal success—whether it be measured in terms of money, power, position, 
                 prestige, influence, or the accumulation of wealth."</big></p>

            <p><big>"No one likes being powerless, yet we don’t take well to power-hungry people due to our modern ideologies of fairness, 
                equity etc. It’s important to realize that power is amoral—it’s neither good nor evil. You can choose how to use power once you have it,
                 but it’d be foolish to dismiss power as bad or unimportant. In fact, there’s much that we can learn from the masterful
                  scheming of the aristocratic courts of the past—those who can subtly charm, deceive and manipulate without others’ awareness can 
                  rise to power without others’ resentment or resistance.</big></p>
